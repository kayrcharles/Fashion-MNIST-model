# Fashion-MNIST-model
In the following code I created a deep learning model while following the PyTorch documenation tutorials online ( will provide the link below). The goal of this model is to take in the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which includes pixelated images of articles of clothing, and be able to name the correct article. The model goes through 10 batches of training, which leads to a 92% accuracy in the end. The model type I used was a multi-layered model, with only one hidden layer.
